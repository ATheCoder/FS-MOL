### Install The dependencies

The following packages dont need any special treatment for different devices so you can just install them using `pip`

```
pip install py-repo-root dpu_utils rdkit more_itertools pyprojroot gradient
```

These packages need to be installed for your specific version of cuda and pytorch. You can use the installation guide given by the library itself:
